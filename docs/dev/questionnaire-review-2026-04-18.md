# Questionnaire Requirements Review — 2026-04-18

Review of Richard's feedback on the questionnaire. Each item is classified as **NEW**, **EXISTING (modify)**, or **EXISTING (remove)**, with file references and a description of the gap.

---

## 1. Bank accounts: type + last 4 — NEW

Current: [Section15ClosedBankAccounts.tsx](../../client/src/components/form-sections/Section15ClosedBankAccounts.tsx) only covers *closed* accounts (already has `typeOfAccount` + `acctNo`). Active bank accounts only appear in Section 26 Assets as "Bank Deposits" (bank name + amount only).

**Work**: add account type and last 4 of account number to active bank accounts in Section 26.

## 2. Financed items like vehicles — EXISTING (modify)

[Section26Assets.tsx:88-98](../../client/src/components/form-sections/Section26Assets.tsx#L88-L98) — `financedItems[]` only has `item` and `companyNameAddress`.

**Work**: expand to mirror Section 27 vehicle fields — payment amount, `lenderName`, `lenderAddress`, `loanNumber`, `percentageRate`, `currentBalance`, terms.

## 3. House/mortgage, household expenses, members of household — NEW

None of these sections exist. Only residential *lease* in Section 1.

**Work**: build new section(s). See open question on scope.

## 4. Unsecured debts help text — EXISTING (modify)

[Section25UnsecuredDebts.tsx:10-12](../../client/src/components/form-sections/Section25UnsecuredDebts.tsx#L10-L12).

**Work**: update prompt to clarify "list debts that don't show up on your credit report — we import the rest."

## 5. Remove "creditor can take property" + dispute questions — EXISTING (remove)

[Section24SecuredDebts.tsx:12,33-35](../../client/src/components/form-sections/Section24SecuredDebts.tsx#L12) — has `agreedCreditorCanTake`, `disputeSecuredDebts`, `disputedSecuredDetails`.

**Work**: remove these (implied by being secured). Reword section header to scope "outside of mortgages."

## 6. Credit cards: 90-day question + remove finance-collateral — MIXED

[Section22CreditCards.tsx](../../client/src/components/form-sections/Section22CreditCards.tsx).

- `financeCollateral` exists at line 19 → **remove** (CCs aren't secured).
- 90-day pre-filing debts question → **add (NEW)**.

## 7. Accidents — open claims/lawsuits — EXISTING (modify)

[Section20Accidents.tsx](../../client/src/components/form-sections/Section20Accidents.tsx) covers vehicle accidents only. Section 8 has `possibleLawsuit` (lawsuits *they* could file).

**Work**: add a question for open claims or lawsuits where they could be sued OR receive money. See open question on placement.

## 8. Former marriages — EXISTING (modify)

[Section19AlimonySupport.tsx:9-11](../../client/src/components/form-sections/Section19AlimonySupport.tsx#L9) — has `previousMarriages` + `formerSpouseName` only.

**Work**: scope to last 8 years, add state of residence during marriage, add former spouse address. See open question on multiplicity.

## 9. Lease details: name/address/terms — EXISTING (modify)

Residential lease in [Section1NameResidence.tsx:32-41](../../client/src/components/form-sections/Section1NameResidence.tsx#L32-L41) already has these. Auto leases in [Section18Leases.tsx](../../client/src/components/form-sections/Section18Leases.tsx) only have a yes/no + free-text blob.

**Work**: convert auto leases to structured array with creditor name, address, terms (mirror residential).

## Richard Needs to Answer

- [ ] **(3) Housing/expenses/household scope** — Three separate sections, or one combined "Household & Housing"? Should the expenses section follow Schedule J line items?
- [ ] Yes Expenses shoudl follow Schedule J line items and have room for additional categories to be added. Once combined section shoudl be ok.  
- [ ] 
- [ ] **(6) 90-day question scope** — Is the "incurred debts in 90 days prior to filing" question credit-card-specific, or does it belong on all unsecured debts? (Presumption-of-fraud lookback is broader than CCs.)
- [ ] This relates to CONSUMER DEBT.  So this includes vehicles and mortgage but would not include business, IRS, child support etc.  Consumer debt are expenses that benefit the household.  It's ok to pay secured debti witin 90 days of filing but we don't like to see big credit card payments for example as that can unfairly beneift one creditor over another and trustee can claw back funds so it shoudl set off a red flag and advise to wait to file.
- [ ] 
- [ ] **(7) Open claims placement** — Add to Section 20 (Accidents) or consolidate with Section 8 (Lawsuits)?
- [ ] Keep seperate because an accident doesn't mean there is a lawsuit. We want to know if they have any personal injury claims so we can list this as an asset and exempt it.
- [ ] 
- [ ] **(8) Former marriages multiplicity** — Should this become a repeating array to capture multiple prior marriages, or stay single-spouse? We do need to know marriages for both spaces within a community property state in the last 8 years, so whatever gathers that information.
